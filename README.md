# ftp-deploy

Deploy your files with FTP. It looks for list of files and their md5sum in **remote-file** and compare with local generated files. Any change of local files will be uploaded in this order:
1) Add all new files
2) Update all modified files
3) Delete all deleted files

If the order is different, active visitors of the website can see 404 pages because for example a modified file has an added menu item to a page which is not yet uploaded.
Another case is that a file is deleted before the files referring to it are updated.

# Options

* `destination` (required) Full FTP path to upload to. Should start with ftp:// and end with wwwroot or public_html
* `username` (required) Username to connect to FTP server.
* `password` (required) Password to connect to FTP server
* `remote-file` (optional, default is a *remote.txt*) It is a list of md5sum and filename (one filename in one row). It is should be kept synchronized with files. If it loses synchronization, simple remove all files from destination and they will be uploaded again and *remote.txt* regenerated.
* `timeout` (optional, default is 20) Since uploading large number of files may take a long time you can define TIMEOUT when to stop before wercker stops the script. 
* `source` (optional, default to $WERCKER_SOURCE_DIR) source folder to be copied to FTP

# Example

Add PASSWORD as protected environment variable. Other options can be hardcoded.
